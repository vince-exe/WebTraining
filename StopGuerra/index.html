            <p class="text-container">By air, land, and sea, Russia has launched a devastating attack on Ukraine, a European democracy of 44 million people, and its forces are on the outskirts of the capital, Kyiv.
               For months, President Vladimir Putin denied he would invade his neighbour, but then he tore up a peace deal, sending forces across borders in Ukraine's north, east and south. 
               As the number of dead climbs, he stands accused of shattering peace in Europe. What happens next could jeopardise the continent's entire security structure.

                Only President Putin and his trusted inner circle know how deep into Ukraine he intends to send his troops.
                As long as Russia's potential invasion force remains massed on the borders then even the bustling Ukrainian capital Kyiv, and other cities, will not be safe from attack.
                But the absolute red line for Nato and the West is if Russia threatens a Nato member state.
                Under Nato's Article 5 the entire western military alliance is obliged to come to the defence of any member state that comes under attack.
                Ukraine is not a member of Nato, although it has said it wants to join - something President Putin is determined to block.
                Eastern European countries like Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania or Poland - once part of Moscow's orbit in Soviet times - are all now Nato members.
                They are feeling distinctly nervous that Russian forces might not stop at Ukraine and instead use some pretext to "come to the aid" of the ethnic Russian minorities in the Baltics and invade.
                Hence Nato has recently sent reinforcements to bolster its Eastern European members as a deterrent.
                So how worried should you be? As long as there is no direct conflict between Russia and Nato then there is no reason for this crisis, bad as it is, to descend into a full-scale world war.
