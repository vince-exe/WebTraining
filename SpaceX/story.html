                        In 2001, Elon Musk conceptualized Mars Oasis, a project to land a miniature
                        experimental greenhouse and grow plants on Mars, in an attempt to revive public
                        interest in space exploration. Musk traveled to Moscow, Russia with Mike Griffin
                        and tried to purchase cheap and refurbished Dnepr rockets but returned empty-handed
                        after failing to find rockets for an affordable price. On the flight home Musk
                        realized that he could start a company to build the affordable rockets he needed
                        instead. By applying vertical integration,using cheap commercial off-the-shelf
                        components when possible,and adopting the modular approach of modern
                        software engineering, Musk believed SpaceX could significantly cut launch price.
                        In early 2002, Musk started to look for staff for his new space company,
                        soon to be named SpaceX. Musk approached rocket engineer Tom Mueller
                        (later SpaceX's CTO of propulsion) and invited him to become his business partner.
                        Mueller agreed to work for Musk, and thus SpaceX was born.SpaceX was first
                        headquartered in a warehouse in El Segundo, California.
                        Early SpaceX employees such as Tom Mueller (CTO),
                        Gwynne Shotwell (COO) and Chris Thompson (VP of Operations) came from neighboring
                        TRW and Boeing corporations following the cancellation of the Brilliant Pebbles
                        program.By November 2005, the company had 160 employees.Musk personally interviewed
                        and approved all of SpaceX's early employees. Musk has stated that one of his goals
                        with SpaceX is to decrease the cost and improve the reliability of access to space,
                        ultimately by a factor of ten.

                        SpaceX first achieved a successful landing and recovery of a first stage
                        in December 2015 with Falcon 9 Flight 20. In April 2016, the company achieved
                        the first successful landing on the autonomous spaceport drone ship (ASDS)
                        Of Course I Still Love You in the Atlantic Ocean. By October 2016, following
                        the successful landings, SpaceX indicated they were offering their customers
                        a 10% price discount if they choose to fly their payload on a reused Falcon 9
                        first stage.
                        A second major rocket failure happened in early September 2016,
                        when a Falcon 9 exploded during a propellant fill operation for a standard
                        pre-launch static fire test. The payload, the Amos-6 communications
                        satellite valued at US$200 million, was destroyed. The explosion was caused by
                        the liquid oxygen that is used as propellant turning so cold that it solidified
                        and ignited with carbon composite helium vessels. Though not considered
                        an unsuccessful flight, the rocket explosion sent the company into a four-month
                        launch hiatus while it worked out what went wrong. SpaceX returned to flight
                        in January 2017.
                        Later that year, in March 2017, SpaceX launched a returned Falcon 9 for the SES-10
                        satellite. This was the first time a re-launch of a payload-carrying orbital rocket
                        went back to space. The first stage was recovered again, also making
                        it the first landing of a reused orbital class rocket

                        In July 2017, the company raised US$350 million for a valuation of US$21 billion.
                        In 2017, SpaceX achieved a 45% global market share for awarded commercial launch
                        contracts. By March 2018, SpaceX had more than 100 launches on its manifest
                        representing about US$12 billion in contract revenue. The contracts included both
                        commercial and government (NASA/DOD) customers. This made SpaceX the leading
                        global commercial launch provider measured by manifested launches.
                        In 2017, SpaceX formed a subsidiary, The Boring Company, and began
                        work to construct a short test tunnel on and adjacent to the SpaceX
                        headquarters and manufacturing facility, utilizing a small number of SpaceX
                        employees, which was completed in May 2018,[66] and opened to the public
                        in December 2018. During 2018, The Boring Company was spun out into a separate
                        corporate entity with 6% of the equity going to SpaceX, less than 10%
                        to early employees, and the remainder of the equity to Elon Musk.

                        In January 2019 SpaceX announced it would lay off 10% of its workforce in order
                        to help finance the Starship and Starlink projects. Construction of initial
                        prototypes and tests for Starship started in early 2019 in Florida and Texas.
                        All Starship construction and testing moved to the new SpaceX South Texas
                        launch site later that year. In May 2019 SpaceX also launched the first large
                        batch of 60 Starlink satellites, beginning the deployment of what would become
                        the world's largest commercial satellite constellation the following year.
                        The company raised a total of US$1.33 billion of capital across three funding
                        rounds in 2019. By May 2019, the valuation of SpaceX had risen to
                        US$33.3 billion and reached US$36 billion by March 2020.
                        A major milestone was achieved in May 2020, when SpaceX successfully launched
                        two NASA astronauts (Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken)
                        into orbit on a Crew Dragon spacecraft during Crew Dragon Demo-2, making SpaceX
                        the first private company to send astronauts to the International Space Station
                        and marking the first crewed orbital launch from American soil in 9 years.
                        The mission launched from Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39A (LC-39A)
                        of the Kennedy Space Center in Florida.
                        On 19 August 2020, after a US$1.9 billion funding round, one of the largest single fundraising
                        pushes by any privately held company, SpaceX's valuation increased to US$46 billion.
                        In February 2021, SpaceX raised an additional US$1.61 billion in an equity round from 99
                        investors at a per share value of approximately $420,[78] raising the company valuation
                        to approximately US$74 billion. By 2021, SpaceX had raised a total of more than US$6 billion
                        in equity financing. Most of the capital raised since 2019 has been used to support the
                        operational fielding of the Starlink satellite constellation and the development and
                        manufacture of the Starship launch vehicle. By October 2021, the valuation of SpaceX
                        had risen to US$100.3 billion. By 2021, SpaceX had entered into agreements with Google
                        Cloud Platform and Microsoft Azure to provide on-ground computer and networking services
                        for Starlink.
                        In July 2021, SpaceX unveiled another drone ship named A Shortfall of Gravitas,
                        landing a booster from CRS-23 on it for the first time on 29 August 2021.
